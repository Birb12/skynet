# skynet

Need to make, train, and implement an AI model in 50 seconds or less? Skynet is your program.

Skynet makes AI easy: With just a few commands, you can build, train, and implement your AI model.

Skynet is a CLI built in Python.

Skynet's commands are below:

Start: Start skynet. You will be greeted with a menu to pick a pre-loaded AI model.

Customize: Customize the pre-loaded AI model -- You can customize the optimizer, number of epochs, learning rate, and more.

Train: Trains the pre-loaded AI model after customization, assuming you uploaded a dataset or used skynet's dataset finding feature when using start.

Implement: Implements the pre-loaded AI model after training. For linear regression, you can input two x-values, and for all other models, you can input the path of one image.
